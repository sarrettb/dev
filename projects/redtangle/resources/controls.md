# Redtangle Controls
Redtangle requires a mouse to play. To move a piece, left click on your piece to select it then left click on the square you desire to move to. To rotate a piece, use the scroll on your mouse. Scrolling up rotates clockwise, scrolling down rotates counter-clockwise. Once you rotate, your piece is locked and you can only rotate. You must right click to end your turn. To double jump, perform the first jump by selecting your piece and selecting the square to jump to then select the next square to jump to. End your turn once you are finished jumping. To jump off the board, select the piece you are trying to capture and both pieces will be captured.
