# Introduction
This repo contains all code related to the development of my software development/engineering skills. The plan is to contain problems solved in DSA, system design, and side projects. The main goal is to document my software development journey. 

# DSA
This subfolder includes problems solved from the [Geeks for Geeks Course](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/courses/dsa-self-paced?utm_source=gfg&utm_medium=Submenu&utm_campaign=courses-submenu) I am enrolled in as well as [Leet Code](https://leetcode.com/) problems. The folder structure should follow the following format: `dev/dsa/platform/topic`.
