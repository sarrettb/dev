# Introduction
This repo contains personal software development projects and courses/trainings I have worked on. 

## IBM Full Stack Developer
- `ibm-full-stack-dev` contains project/source-controlled work completed during this course.
- Each folder maps to a module in the course
  
## Redtangle 
- `redtangle` is a board game similar to chess that has been converted into a desktop application. 
- The game supports playing verse another player remotely, via communication with a gRPC server.
- You can also play two player mode (specified at compile time) on the same computer by sharing a mouse. 
- See [TUTORIAL.md](redtangle/TUTORIAL.md) for a walk through of the game.
  
## Helloworld gRPC 
- `helloworld-grpc` is a starter project for building gRPC client,  server, and deploying the server on an AWS Machine.  
- It also provided a good exercise on how to build C++ applications with CMake.
  
## BUtility 
- `butility` stands for "Blake's Utility" which is meant to be a folder to host any common C++ code that could be shared among different projects. 
- Currently, there is only one function here to assist in parsing command line arguments.
